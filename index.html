        <p class="tab">Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia I attended St. Pius X Catholic High School and then
          chose to study Engineering in college, with my two top choices being Georgia Institute of
          Technology (my parents are Alumni) or the United States Merchant Marine Academy. As luck would have
          it&hellip;
          I chose the latter. After spending four years at the academy, I graduated with a Bachelor&#39;s of
          Science in
          Marine Engineering Systems, and a commission in the Naval Reserve.</p>
        <p class="tab">Following graduation I began working for the
          U.S. Navy&#39;s Military Sealift Command, a government company whose mission is to support the U.S.
          Navy vessels throughout the world, we deployed with all their strike groups and assist them by
          delivering
          their food, fuel, ammunition, and mail via Underway Replenishments. I spent over six years working
          as an
          engineer on seven different ships in the fleet. On a ship underway you don&#39;t have the luxury of
          calling for a repairman if anything goes wrong, that is what the engineers are there for. As an
          engineer I had to do it all&hellip;
          or learn quickly, which is what I love to do&hellip; learn something new, and then become the best
          possible at it.</p>
        <p class="tab">After spending so much time away from land, I decided that a change was in order and that
          I wanted to get a job back on dry land, and began to explore another big passion of mine&hellip;
          technology. I have always loved computers and everything tech related, and working as a web
          developer gives me the opportunity to explore that passion on a daily basis. I am able to employ my
          inventiveness, creativity, logic, and thirst for learning constantly as I work and it gives me great
          satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="tab">My other passions include motorcycling (I currently own a 2013 Ninja 300 and it is my
          daily vehicle), Rubik&#39;s cubes (I have quite a few of them to say the least ranging from 2x2x2s
          up to
          a 15x15x15 as well as all sizes of -minxs), reading, and meditation.</p>
