# Basic-Portfolio

This is the first draft of my portfolio done for Homework Assignment #1 done simply using HTML and CSS.  I have gone back to make revisions and clean up the code not only for functionality, but to make everything easier to read.  This is by no means the last time I will return to make changes to my portfolio... it just also gave me a space to play around in.
